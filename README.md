# Todo App in Go and Fyne

A simple (and incomplete) todo app, written in Go and using Fyne (GUI). 

## Prerequisites

You should have [Go](https://go.dev/) installed on your machine.

Optionally, I use [Just](https://just.systems/) as my command runner.

## Getting Started

1. If haven't already, clone the repo:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:kensonjohnson/go-fyne-todo-app.git
cd go-fyne-todo-app
```

2. Fetch needed dependencies: `just tidy` or `go mod tidy`

3. Run the app: `just run` or `go run .`
